Therapeutics are just as diverse, encompassing pharmacology, electromagnetic interactions, and opto-genetics as well as nanotechnology.  Traditional interdisciplinary research involved bringing researchers together across these disciplines, whereas increasingly, the key researchers are able to straddle multiple disciplines and translating and synthesizing in a way that is difficult or impossible as a conversation between disciplines.

I intend to establish a program based on the original Media Lab design but serving as a link between MIT and the outside world.  As participants/designers, we will be focusing on changing the way we do things in order to change the way the world does things.  Thus I will recruit collaborators from across MIT and beyond.
